## Validation

### HTML Validation

On the HTML validation, there were no errors.


There were warnings, but they were all related to Bootstrap 5 and how they designed their components. In this instance, the validator pointed out elements inside a  p  tag or  button tag without any text. 

another warning had to do with the <link> tag that Bootstrap gave me the CDN; some fields seem not to be liked by the validator.

Testing Result: Passed âœ…

> Elaboration: The admin page was thoroughly tested, and it was confirmed that users with admin privileges had their dedicated admin page. This page provided access to additional administrative features and settings, enabling admins to manage users and exercises effectively.

3.3  Can Delete users and their exercises âœ…

Testing Result: Passed âœ…

> Elaboration: The capability to delete users and their associated exercises was extensively tested. Admin users were able to remove user accounts as well as exercises contributed by any user. Proper checks were in place to prevent accidental or unauthorized deletions.

## Bugs & Fixes

1. Bootstrap 5.3 seems to bring a lot of validation warnings from HTML to JavaScript. It seems also to affect some elements of highlight not always being possible to do the 100%. I fix some of them but some were beyond my control.

2. I probably could make the same template for dashboard, exercises and exercises users, but I has difficulty making the logic work in the app flask. so the 3 templates are very similar. Everything is working.
