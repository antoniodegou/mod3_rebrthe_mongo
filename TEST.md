## Validation

### HTML Validation

On the HTML validation, there were no errors.


There were warnings, but they were all related to Bootstrap 5 and how they designed their components. In this instance, the validator pointed out elements inside a  p  tag or  button tag without any text. 

another warning had to do with the <link> tag that Bootstrap gave me the CDN; some fields seem not to be liked by the validator.
